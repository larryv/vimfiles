This is my [Vim][1] configuration. It is less complicated than it used to be.

To install on a Unix-like system, link or clone a checkout of this repository
to `$HOME/.vim`. [Vim 7.3.1178][2] and later require nothing else; for older
versions, link `vimrc` to `$HOME/.vimrc` and `gvimrc` to `$HOME/.gvimrc`.

For other systems, run [`vim +':help initialization'`][4] to figure out how to
set things up, and good luck.
